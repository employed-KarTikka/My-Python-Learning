This is a code of number guessing in python, I learnt it from youtube, this is a very simple code with help of only loops. I have used VS Code to run it

import random

num = random.randint(1,10)

tries = 0

while True:
    guess = int(input("Guess your number here: "))

    if guess == num:
        tries += 1
        print(f"you are right, you guessed in {tries} tries")
        break

    elif guess > num:
     tries += 1
     print("Your guess is a lil higher, go low")
    
    elif guess < num:
       tries += 1
       print("you guessed a bit low, go higher")

    else:
       tries += 1
