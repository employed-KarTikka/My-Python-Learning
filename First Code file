# Assignment Operators - used to assign Value to variables
# basic assignment operatior is "="

#Compound assigmet operators > used to reassign values directly 
# value = 20
# value += 40
# value += 60
# print(value)

# Comparison Operator - alaways gives answers in Bollean (true or false)
#inclued ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

# Logical Operator - used to combine multiple conditions and return a Bollean value
# and, or, not

#and
# print("A" < "B" and 45 == 45) # all conditions should be True to get True

# #or
# print("A" > "B" or 66 > 99 or 12 <= 13) # Returns True or False even if one of them is despite all being of One tye

#not 
# print(not 15 >= 12) # reverses the Bollean value

# print(not "A" > "B" and 12 <= 12)
# print(not 9999 > 888 or "A" > "B")
